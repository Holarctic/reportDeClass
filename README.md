# reportDeClass
This is a tool that I developed because I was bored and wanted to do something.
It downloads .csv reports from classes in my university and should be able to help me track people and their grades.
Hopefully I will eventually add suport for other universities but I will probably be too lazy. Hoppefully others will start using our system so it will be easier.
In the future I will update this file to reflect current functionality
